# WEB APP : Deep unsupervised learning methods for the identification and characterization of TCR specificity ü´Åü´Ä

This dashboard aims to show how perform the different deep learning methods described in the paper when given a real CDR3 sequence or a personnalized one.



## Guidelines:
1. Choose a model from which the representation will be computed.
2. Type your own CDR3 sequence or click on the 'Generate' button to generate an existing CDR3 sequence at random.

## Results:
- The predicted embedding is computed and displayed.
- The predicted clustering is also displayed below the plot.
